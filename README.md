# text_to_image
# Text to Image Project with OpenAI

This project uses OpenAI's text-to-image generation capabilities to generate images from text descriptions.

To use the project, simply run the following command:

"
python generate_image.py <text_description>
"

The script will generate an image file named image.png in the current directory.

The following are some examples of text descriptions that you can use to generate images:

"A red cat sitting on a green couch"
"A landscape with mountains, trees, and a river"
"A portrait of a woman with brown hair and blue eyes"
You can also use more complex text descriptions to generate more creative images. For example, you could try the following text description:

"
A surreal landscape with a floating island in the sky and a waterfall that flows upwards
"

The project is still under development, but it is already capable of generating some impressive results. Try it out and see what kind of images you can create!
